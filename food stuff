<p> This homepage will be used as a host of links to various resteraunts and foods based 
off of the type's of food we love to eat. the two types of food we love eating are fast 
food and seafood. Joshua likes Fried Chicken because it can taste good at times and is cheap.
Nyle likes seafood because the sea/ocean itself is a very vast and big place with tons 
of marine life to eat to this day i have yet to experience half of what the sea can offer my tatse buds.
